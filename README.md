# Pizza-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard
A data analytics portfolio project designed to analyze pizza business performance using historical sales data. This project combines MySQL (SQL queries) for KPI calculation and data analysis with a fully interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard for visualization. The dashboard highlights key sales metrics, order trends, product performance, and customer purchasing behavior.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes pizza sales performance using MySQL for querying and calculating business KPIs and Microsoft Excel for data preparation and dashboard visualization. SQL was used to extract insights such as revenue, order trends, and best-selling items, while Excel was used to transform the results into a clear, interactive dashboard for business decision-making.

## Objective
To design and develop an interactive Pizza Sales Analytics Dashboard that delivers insights into revenue performance, order behavior, pizza category and size distribution, and best- and worst-selling products using SQL-driven analysis and Excel-based visualization.

## Tools Used
- MySQL – data analysis, KPI calculations, trend analysis
- SQL Queries – aggregations, grouping, filtering, ranking
- Microsoft Excel – data cleaning, preprocessing, dashboard creation
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts – data summarization and visualization
- Excel Formulas – KPI metrics and calculations
- Slicers & Filters – interactive date and period analysis

## SQL Analysis (MySQL)
- Total Revenue
- Average Order Value
- Total Pizzas Sold
- Total Orders
- Average Pizzas per Order
- Daily Trend for Total Orders
- Hourly Trend for Orders
- Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category
- Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size
- Top 5 Best-Selling Pizzas
- Bottom 5 Worst-Selling Pizzas

## Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)
- Removed duplicate and blank records
- Standardized date and time formats
- Cleaned inconsistent pizza category and size labels
- Verified numerical fields (quantity and revenue)
- Validated pizza names and categories
- Created calculated fields based on SQL outputs:
    - Total Revenue
