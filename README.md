# Pizza-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard
A data analytics portfolio project designed to analyze pizza business performance using historical sales data. This project combines MySQL (SQL queries) for KPI calculation and data analysis with a fully interactive Microsoft Excel dashboard for visualization. The dashboard highlights key sales metrics, order trends, product performance, and customer purchasing behavior.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes pizza sales performance using MySQL for querying and calculating business KPIs and Microsoft Excel for data preparation and dashboard visualization. SQL was used to extract insights such as revenue, order trends, and best-selling items, while Excel was used to transform the results into a clear, interactive dashboard for business decision-making.

## Objective

- SQL Queries – aggregations, grouping, filtering, ranking
- Microsoft Excel – data cleaning, preprocessing, dashboard creation
- Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts – data summarization and visualization
